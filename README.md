# Deep-Learning

## Project 1_First-neural-network

Built a neural network and used it to predict daily bike rental ridership.

## Project 2_Image_Classification

Classified images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. Preprocessed the images, then train a convolutional neural network on all the samples. The images were normalized and the labels one-hot encodeded. Built a convolutional neural network with max pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers. 

## Project 3_Generate_TV_Scripts

Generating TV scripts using Recurrent Neural Networks

## Project 4_Language_Translation

Trained a sequence to sequence model on a dataset of English and French sentences that can translate new sentences from English to French.

## Project 5_Face_Generation_Changes

Used generative adversarial networks to generate new images of faces.
